**Setup:**

Most resources are also available from the leaderboard’s [resources](https://www.speedrun.com/pvzgw2/resources) section.** \
**

**[LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/)**** (recommended) **A speedrunning timer made by speedrunners.

**↪ ****[LiveSplit Development Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.github.io/artifacts/LiveSplitDevBuild.zip)**** (unstable) **Development build of LiveSplit.

**[Pre-Made Splits](https://www.speedrun.com/pvzgw2/resources)**** (optional) **Splits for categories.

**Advanced:**

**[ReTiming Tool 2.0.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k9PSUFmf6nxc3rOZChA-bomzoRHZeUeR/view?usp=sharing)**** (optional) **ReTiming Tool made by Zonby.

**↪ ****[Mirror (speedrun.com)](https://www.speedrun.com/static/resource/q9f1k.zip?v=c033f7d)**

**[Frame Count](https://somewes.com/frame-count/)**** (alternative to ReTiming Tool) **Another tool for timing your runs. This is not maintained by any PvZ GW2 speedrunning staff.

**[ReTiming Tool 1.2.3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VQH20ljSYoeTXUnZHijDkKhjBMsf4Nxi/view?usp=sharing)**** (not recommended) **ReTiming Tool made by Zonby. Old version, not recommended if 2.0.0 runs fine.

**In-Game Settings:**

**Video:**

Most likely you will want to use at least Medium for simplicity and high FPS. You can still use Low if you have a really low FPS. Higher graphics will cause lag which you will not want and it’s not required.

It is also strongly recommended to set your FOV to a higher value instead of the default value. To change your FOV, go to %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Plants vs Zombies GW2\settings, open “PROF_SAVE_profile” with any text editor and change “GstRender.FieldOfView” to the value to desired one by your chance.

**Rules & Timing:**

**Proof:**

All runs HAVE to be submitted with some sort of proof in the form of a video.

Videos have to show the full run from start to finish.

Top 25 runs HAVE to be submitted with a live recording with LiveSplit enabled.

**No Skip Restriction:**

Beat the game as fast as possible.

**No Major Skips:**

You can complete sets of quests in the order you like, but before switching to the next one, you need to complete the previous one completely.

Skips that require other quests are only allowed if you do them chronologically (quest 2 glitch setup then quest 3 glitched for example).

**Glitchless:**

Movement glitches (like bean jump, Citron dash cancel, Superhero kick) are allowed.

The following glitches are banned:

Invincibility glitch,

Skipping a quest by completing the previous one while doing the current one,

Keeping older quests active to gain advantages,

Any text box skip/cancel,

Captain Smasher insta-kill,

The Bean Situation skip,

Customizations that give a visual advantage are banned, the ones that don't are allowed.

Placing Grow-a-Pot or Build-a-Bot is not allowed, however, AI helpers (heroes) are allowed as long as they are default characters.

**Crazy Targets:**

This category is timed in RTA (Real Time Attack) but for aesthetic reasons, the times will be in the "Time with Loads" column, because it represents the RTA.

Runs timed with the in-game timer will be retimed to match with the real time elapsed.

Complete the course from start to finish by only using the selected character.

You’re allowed to use any variant, ability or upgrade from any character.

No assist from other players allowed except in the Assisted category.

Clipping through the iron doors (the moving ones using warp or dashes) is allowed.

Clipping through the iron doors while goatified is not allowed.

Shooting through the iron doors (when they are moving) is allowed.

The shooting range must be clean (with no summonable abilities or characters inside).

Future Dummy, Heal Station, Potato Mine, etc. exploits are not allowed.

Game breaking exploits are going to be judged and if necessary, will make the run get <span style="text - decoration: underline;">REJECTED</span>.

You can use any characters (unless Assistant Manager Bitey and Zomburger Artist).

Time starts when “Go!” appears on the screen after the countdown.

Time ends as soon as you hit the last target.

**Timing:**

Most of the runs are timed as Load Removed Time (LRT).

Time begins when the quest selection screen starts to fade after clicking 'Start Quest' at the first quest you selected to start with.

Time ends when the last quest you selected ends.

**Loading Screens Retiming:**

Entering a map

Loading screen starts at the first frame of the quest confirm text disappearing.

Loading screen ends at the first frame of the character selection screen.

Exiting to the Backyard Battleground

Loading screen starts at the first frame of the screen turning black after pressing "Return to Backyard".

Loading screen ends when the player does a movement (either camera, character, or a menu interaction).

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">Movement**</span>** (*****[video tutorial](https://youtu.be/67tZ0MkLFsM)*****):**

**Neutral Jumping:**

When holding a directional input, your character speed locks with the corresponding speed you must have and in mid-air, that speed is even lower. If you want to perform jumps without losing a little of speed, just jump and don’t press any directional inputs.

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">Citron Spin Dash Cancel**</span>** (*****[video](https://youtu.be/vEi__8STTZ8)*****):**

Citron Spin Dash has 3 phases:

1. Charge

2. Acceleration

3. Speed Losing

To perform this glitch, you have two alternatives:

- You must be in mid air during the switch from phase 2->3.

- Canceling your Spin Dash ability before reaching the phase 2->3 switch using your cancel button.

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">Citron High Jump**</span>** (*****[video](https://youtu.be/ls7067HO_fk)*****):**

Use your citron ball speed boost ability (hyper ball), then jump, as soon as you press the jump button, press your cancel button.

**Double Bean Jump:**

You have to trigger your Hyper ability, then, jumping, throwing a bean bomb, and then, spamming the jump button. That's the easiest way to perform the trick, but, with a good timing, you can get one of the jump variants:

- Height ++

- Speed ++

- Speed + and Height +

- Gliding (Slow)

**Bean Push:**

Bean Bomb collisions are glitched, and with it, you can abuse their geometry collisions to get pushed-teleported in a random direction, if you are lucky enough, you can escape from death, or reach your destination faster.

**Burrow Speed Keeping Momentum:**

Burrow gives chomper additional speed, that can be used to travel or annoy zombies, and, as told here, you can keep that speed using momentum as soon as the ability ends, or, canceling the ability manually, and jump as soon as you land. You can get a better effect using Hot Rod Chomper + 2 speed boosts + Sprint Burrow.

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">Jackhammer Speed Keeping**</span>** (*****[video](https://youtu.be/i8dJF5BpWXI)*****):**

Turbo Jackhammer and Jackhammer gives you additional speed (x2.0 Turbo and x1.5 Default) and jumping height boost (x1.3 Turbo and x1.4 Default), and once they end (or you cancel), you can use momentum to keep that speed for a longer time.

**Dash Speed Preserve:**

There is one thing in common about almost every dash ability, they won’t block your speed after it finishes, so, if you don’t perform any directional movement input after it finishes, and make sure to jump as soon as your character touches the ground, you will keep that speed.

The most common use for this trick is done with Superhero’s Heroic Kick ability.

**Husk Hop Momentum:**

You can use Husk Hop ability to get linear speed, basically, you have to release every directional input, and jump as soon as you reach the ground. It is suggested that you jump before triggering the ability, because you will end up a little close to the ground, and like that, you won't lose much speed.

** \
****<span style="text - decoration: underline;">Backwards Boosting**</span>** (*****[video](https://youtu.be/a95KdRsH-KA)*****):**** \
**There are only two abilities that allows you to use this trick to grind a little speed while mid-air: \
	- Soldier’s Rocket Jump \
	- Assistant Manager Bitey’s Rocket Jump (only available in "Chomper's Pizza" category) \
To perform this trick, you have to use the ability, and while you are in the air, quickly go backwards, and then forward. The most optimal way to perform this, is as soon as your character gets a launch force when using that ability.

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">Throwable Mounting:**</span>** \
**You can mount some spawnable abilities with a spherical-like hitbox to get one of the following:

- Getting that ability launch speed added to your speed.

- Perform double jumps.

- Getting launched with a tremendous speed in an inconsistent direction.

The following abilities are the most common to perform that set of actions:

- Chili Bean Bomb (Peashooter)

- Mega Heal Bomb (Scientist)

- Imp Punt (All-Star)

**Tackle Speed Preserve:**

All-Star has two Tackle abilities, the default one (fast), and the alternative one (damage, slow recharge and no speed boost after it ends), you must use Tackle while (extra speed if done mid-air), and then not doing movement inputs, plus jumping.

**General Glitches:**

**Extended Goatify Glitch:**

Regular Goatify lasts for 7 seconds (and Psychedelic Goatify 5 seconds), but you can extend that time if your game is paused. In split screen both players must be in pause screen for this glitch to work.

**Damage Multiplier Glitch:**

With this backyard exclusive glitch you can multiply your damage by x3 if you are alone, and x6/x7 if you have another player in your backyard. Steps:

- Start flag of power minigame as the objective team that will receive the damage multiplicator.

- Let the opposite team capture at least 85%.

- When the objective team is about to lose the flag, make sure a rose goatifies the player(s) of the objective team.

- Once the flag falls, players that got goatified will receive the damage multiplier as soon as the goatify state runs out.

Notes:

- The first time the glitch is done, base damage will be boosted by x3.

- The second consecutive time the glitch is done, base damage will be boosted by x6.

- The third and last consecutive time the glitch is done, base damage will be boosted by x7.

- This glitch can only be done 3 times until it loses effect.

- When the affected player(s) respawn, the damage multiplicator will be gone.

- If a player gets goatified at the last second before the flag runs out, he will die, make sure to wait until the flag has a few seconds to spare before falling.

**Invincibility Glitch:**

This can only be done in the Backyard. Press the button to interact with a Backyard statue customization and the menu button to bring up the options menu at the same time, if done right you should see the perspective of selecting your statue and the menu at the same time. Simply exit out of the menu and press the button to interact two times and exit fully out into the normal perspective.

**Water-Invincibility Glitch:**

This can only be done in the Backyard. This glitch makes you able to get no instakill damage from water (docks and sewers, not lava or OoB instakill).

- Start Citron’s third quest.

- Play the quest as usual.

- Free Iron Ball.

- Once you get teleported away from that zone, and without getting closer to the objective, pause the game.

- Respawn.

- Swap your team.

**Team Swap Glitch:**

This glitch makes you able to play a zombie character and make the game think it’s a plant, and vice versa.

This glitch requires either a second player, or Assistant Manager Bitey / Zomburger Artist unlocked.

Solo:

- Get nearby the delivery NPC of your choice.

- Interact, and pause, if the camera points directly into the delivery NPC and the pause menu is opened, you did it correctly.

- While holding your left movement key, swap your team, and 1 frame after that select the character of your desire.

- Before 5s passes after you left the character selection screen, select any quest of the 10 available, and wait for the time to run out.

Multiplayer:

- Make sure the other player has Rose on the Plants (if you want a Zombie sided Plant, you need a normal Rose, otherwise you need a Zombie-sided Rose)

- While holding your right movement key, swap your team, and 1 frame after that select the character of your desire.

- The other player must goatify you before 5s passes after you left the character selection screen.

**Imp Roundup Glitch (Pause / No-Pause):**

This glitch makes you able to interact with some interactable objects in moments where you normally can’t. Such as raising the Flag of Power in quests.

No-pause variation:

- Complete the quest, nothing special is involved.

Pause variation:

- Start the quest.

- Play until the part where Imp’s must be taken into the circle.

- Before Imp’s reach the final circle, pause the game, and unpause when they are done laughing.

**Playable Delivery Characters on Opposite Teams:**

If you go up to the delivery area and talk to the Assistant Manager Bitey / Zomburger Artist and then switch teams, choose another character on that team, you will be an Assistant Manager Bitey on the Zombies / Zomburger Artist on the Plants team.

**Skips:**

**Text Box Skip:**

When you finish a quest, there is a message box that displays and lasts for 5 seconds, where you can’t move your character.

If you are in the pause menu, you can delay when that message box will appear, and if you start a new quest when the message box is waiting to be displayed, you will start that quest and after that one starts you will get the box to display.

- If the next quest is done inside the Backyard, the old box will display a few seconds after the new quest starts.

- If the next quest is done outside the Backyard, the old box will not display, saving around 7 seconds.

Quests where this skip can be done:

- Dr. Patient 1

- Dr. Patient 3

- Superhero 2

- Deadbeard 1

- Dr. Fizzician 2

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">Text Box Cancel**</span>** (*****[video](https://youtu.be/xev_LFiIEO0)*****):**

When the quest ends you can see the picture in the quest bar will say “Talk to [NPC]”. When you see this, that means when you unpause the quest will end. If you spam pause button, you will see the text box animation will play, but it will keep your position which saves a bunch of time for a few quests such as “Zomboss Needs You!”.

**Cutscene Delay Glitch:**

When you enter some cutscenes (that require the player to get inside a trigger) and the pause menu is active, you will delay that cutscene activation until you close your pause menu.

Detailed explanation: When you unpause the game, a 2 seconds timer will start to count down, and it will also pause/resume when you pause/unpause the game. Once those 2 seconds run out, the cutscene will display as normal.

This also happens with quest completed message boxes.

**The Bean Situation Skip:**

For this skip you need to complete Z-Mech’s quest 1 first to enable a glitch that makes you able to interact with some elements in unexpected situations, in this case, it will be Flag of Power while doing this quest.

- Start Superbrainz’s quest 3.

- Once the cutscene ends, raise the Flag of Power.

**No Boloney, No Problem! Skip:**

Just ignore the objective and jump into the plant base. The mission objective will change to finding the secret door finder device. Secret door finder device is where the sticker book is.

**Quest Preserve Glitch:**

When a quest finishes, a message box appears. If you swap to the opposite team when that message box is ready to display, the quest summoned items will appear in the backyard like if you just started the quest again, but with some differences:

- The quest will not be active, that means you can swap teams as much as you want and items/NPC(s) won't disappear.

- If you start a different quest from the same character, and you interact with the leftovers of the glitched quest like if you were going to finish it, the quest you just started will be completed. This is useful in Dr. Patient quests 1 & 3, since you can just complete them by just re-beating quest 2.

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">Captain Smasher Skip**</span>** (*****[video](https://youtu.be/SWxN3lfh9Q4)*****)****:**

If during the last quest of L.E.A.F. you are on the edge of the river/creek, and Captain Smasher runs towards you, there is a chance for him to keep his speed and fall into river/creek, and instantly kill him, completing his bossfight without needing to spend time to get into phases 1/2/3.

**Royal Hypno-flower Skip:**

Royal Hypno-flower has 3 phases in her boss fight, they trigger when her health decreases enough.

The 1st phase is inevitable, there is no way to skip it because her HP is locked at 75% and you will need to find a poly leaf to continue doing damage to Hypnoflower.

However, that HP lock isn’t present during her phase 2/3 triggering. You indeed get a message telling you will be transformed into a goat, but it doesn’t stop you from still dealing damage. So, if you use a character with really high DPS (Toxic Brainz, Computer Scientist, Marine Biologist, All-Star, …) you can defeat her before phases 2 and 3 could even be triggered, and in case you miss one of those skips, only phase 2 will come in board if you bypassed phase 3 health minimum (%25).

**Other**

**Coin Spam Glitch**

This glitch makes you able to interact with the same Chest/Snow Globe more than once, collecting the coins dropped by those every time. If we don’t consider the setup, this glitch will grant you around 2M coins every 15 minutes, and in one specific scenario 5000 every 3 seconds.

Required:

- Chest with **0 opening cost**, Snow Globes, some special characters, S-Rank reward ready to claim at the Crazy Targets Range, or a character in level 10 waiting for a promotion.

Steps:

- Setup **Cancel-Yes **(steps below)

- Once you finish doing the inputs, go into the interaction you want to duplicate, and interact multiple times with it until the game does not allow it anymore.

Details:

- When you are filling the interaction circle to open a chest, as soon as you fill the circle, **quickly release, press and release again**, doing those 3 actions will reset the circle again, saving around 1 second. If you do this during all the interaction period, you are probably duplicating the performance of this glitch.

- If you want to promote the same character with Cancel-Yes active, only the first 5 times will give you coins, the following ones will not.

- If you stand on a specific spot on a chest, the hitbox of your character will make all coins spawn with no launch speed, preventing them from falling into the void.

**Cancel-Yes (Goat Lag)**

This glitch generates a weird effect inside the backyard.

Main uses:

- Making chest spam glitch possible.

- Promotion Skip / Negative Levels Glitch.

- 0.00 seconds time at the Crazy Targets range.

- Multiplayer Story mode quests (like Captain Smasher).

Required:

- Having **both** story mode notebooks completed (all badges, both delivery included).

- Completing all Pot/Bot quests around the backyard.

- Collecting all 54 gnomes.

- (PC) Setting your Monitor Hz to 60 or lower (minimum 30 Hz, a value lower than that will make the process really annoying, but the lower the better).

Steps:

- Start Z-Mech’s quest 1 (Imp Roundup).

- Play the quest as normal until you have to wait for the Imp’s to reach the goal.

- Once the Imp’s are almost reaching the final circle, **pause the game **and wait for **at least** one of them to get inside the circle.

- Wait inside the pause menu until the Imp’s stop laughing (that would normally take around 15 seconds).

- Once all Imp’s stop laughing, unpause the game and the quest will resume and finish as normal.

- The following steps depend on what chests you want to open multiple times. My suggestion is to follow the ZOMBIE ROUTE, since there are only 3 chests that are plant exclusive.

- ZOMBIES:

- Go to Zomburger’s Delivery.

- Start quest 3.

- Wait for the timer to run out.

- Once the timer runs out, interact as soon as possible with the Goat. Once you do that the quest selection menu will display.

- PLANTS:

- Go to Chomper’s Pizza.

- Start quest 9 (or any, quest 9 is the shortest).

- Wait for the timer to run out.

- Once the timer runs out, interact as soon as possible with the Chomper. Once you do that the quest selection menu will display.

- Now you are inside the delivery quest selection menu, so, all you need to do now is quickly start a different quest than the one you just selected.

- Once you do that, you will be kicked out of that menu, and get teleported somewhere.

- Now, interact with the Delivery NPC you just interacted with, and you will see a button at the bottom of the screen that says “Cancel Quest” when you hover around the quest you just “failed”. Once you get that button you won’t need to redo the previous steps again since the quest was glitched successfully.

- Repeat the following steps during the recommended minutes;

- Press the “Cancel Quest” button

- PC: Normally it’s the Y Key.

- Xbox: Y

- PS4/PS5: Triangle

- Press “Yes”

- PC: Enter

- Xbox: A

- PS4/PS5: X

- After doing the previous step for the desired time, leave the delivery menu and make whatever you want.

Time restrictions:

- PS4/PS5

- 1 player: No time limit.

- 2 players: Around 30 minutes.

- +2 players: 13 minutes.

- Xbox

- One

- 1 player: No time limit.

- +1 player: 13 minutes.

- Series X/S

- Max Time: 11/12 minutes.

- PC

- No time limit.

Tips:

- Don’t spam Cancel-Yes inputs with no order, because an orderless sequence makes you lose inputs, making it **<span style="text - decoration: underline;">useless**</span>.

- Don’t do the Cancel-Yes inputs slow, because that makes it useless, same as the situation above.

- If you **<span style="text - decoration: underline;">die**</span>, **<span style="text - decoration: underline;">respawn**</span> or **<span style="text - decoration: underline;">warp home**</span>, you will get stuck until the effect runs out. **You won’t be able to do a single thing**.

FAQ

- **Why is this glitch time limited?: **Because when you are opening chests, the game must process all the coins earned, send them to the server, and keep on doing the same. After some research we figured out that these limits are the most optimal ones in order to prevent a game crash.

- **Do I really need both story mode notebooks with all stamps?: **Yes, you do.

- **Do I really need all Pot/Bot quests?: **It is suggested that you complete them all along the story mode badges and 54 gnomes, since every quest you complete and every badge you obtain makes every input to last longer. \
If you collect all 54 gnomes, both story mode badges, and all Pot/Bot quests, then the final glitch’s effect will triplicate the interaction time.

- **Does it work in split screen?: **Nope.

- **Does it work with the chests at the Gnomiverse?: **No, as soon as you try to go into the Gnomiverse the game will wait for the Cancel-Yes to run out before leaving, and if it was enough, if you leave the backyard the effect will just disappear.

- **How can I avoid being kicked by AFK?: **When you are standing still for 15 minutes (in the delivery menu), the game will kick you automatically, but you can prevent it by simply trying to start the glitched quest, or by just leaving the delivery menu, moving your character and going inside again.

- **Why can’t I interact with the chests at the hero's bases? There is an invisible wall: **That “invisible wall” was a vague fix for an out of bounds exploit that was found at the start of the game. It’s not an invisible wall actually, it’s a black cube that disappears once the zone is fully loaded, so, since the Cancel-Yes is messing with the game, that cube becomes invisible, but its collision remains. \
To prevent it you need a 2nd person that pushes your character into the portal that contains the chest you want to open **while** you are inside the Delivery menu without doing the Cancel-Yes inputs yet. It is suggested that you use the default parrot drone (for both plants and zombies, switching to plants again after finishing it) because it makes pushing players easier.

- **Why am I not getting coins? I can clearly see how my player grabs them: **If the pause menu is opened, you will get 0 coins.

- **How can I do it with more people?: **Make sure all players are on the same team as the host of the game, because coins will be shared between members of the same team, and if you want to invite someone, make sure the host is at the Delivery menu before the other players join.
